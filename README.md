# Basics
Hello everyone :-). I'm Christine Liu and I take AP Computer Science. I don't have that much free time these days, but I do have a good amount of interests and hobbies nonetheless.
## Art
Art is something I've always found interest in, even when I was very young. I started picking up on it more seriously at around age 12, and I'm still doing art now too. Admittedly, I don't have much time to dedicate myself fully because of schoolwork, but I do find art enjoyable when I'm able to draw.
